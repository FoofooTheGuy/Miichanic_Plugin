# Miichanic's Tool Box Installer 2.00

An internet connection is required for the app to download the required files! (Miichanic.3gx and boot.firm)
---

- This is an installer for the Miichanic plugin made using WinAPI and Microsoft Visual Studio 2022.
I also took many examples and functions from the internet, so I apologize if I forgot to link something that I found on some website...

- It is nicer than the old batch file version by doing many more things automatically!

- Provided are the most important parts of the program, (main.cpp and dirent.h) instead of uploading the entire project.

Usage example:
